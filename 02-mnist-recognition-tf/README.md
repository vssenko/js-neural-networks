# 02-mnist-recognition-tf
Way less headache with already implemented Neural networks :-)

Here we will go in 2 ways.

First approach - [Feedforward neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FNN), classic solution for binary classification.

Second approach - [Convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), better suited for image recognition.

Maybe in some project later on we will impllement CNN from scratch.

# Presteps
1. [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) should be installed, pleasant quest for Windows users.
2. npm i
3. npm run download-dataset

# Scripts
Things you can do with that:

## `npm run download-dataset`
Download MNIST dataset.

## `npm run train-fnn`
to train and test FNN :-) 

## `npm run train-cnn`
to train and test CNN :-)
